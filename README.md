# Water-level-Indicator-Using-NOT-Gate-IC-7404
This project uses NOT gates (IC 7404), BC547 transistors, and LEDs to monitor water levels. Jumper wires simulate water levels, triggering NOT gates that activate transistors to light LEDs. Resistors limit current, ensuring safe operation. This simple system offers an easy, cost-effective way to test water level detection without sensors.
